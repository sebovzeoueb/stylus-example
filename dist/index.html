        <p><span class="intro">In publishing and graphic design,</span> <i>Lorem ipsum</i> is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. <i>Lorem ipsum</i> may be used before final copy is available, but it may also be used to temporarily replace copy in a process called greeking, which allows designers to consider form without the meaning of the text influencing the design.</p>
        <p><i>Lorem ipsum</i> is typically a corrupted version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_finibus_bonorum_et_malorum" target="_blank"><i>De finibus bonorum et malorum</i></a>, a first-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical, improper Latin.</p>
        <p>Versions of the <i>Lorem ipsum</i> text have been used in typesetting at least since the 1960s, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets. <i>Lorem ipsum</i> was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s when Aldus employed it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker. Other popular word processors including Pages and Microsoft Word have since adopted Lorem ipsum as well.</p>

        <p>This part of the page could contain cool features of my web app, but this is just a demo.</p>
        <p>So it just has this page with an extract from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum" target="_blank">Wikipedia article about Lorem Ipsum</a>.</p>

        <p>I'm amazed that you're still reading, considering that this is a demo page with no interesting text whatsoever.</p>
